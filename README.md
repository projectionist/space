The master branch is a base for [projections](http://projectionist.array.bz/projections/) which use a 3D scene.

See `projection/*` branches of this repo for 3D-scene projections.
See `http://github.com/projectionist/scratch` for an empty project.

These projections require `glm` to be installed.  
Use `apt-get install libglm-dev`.

For a more general overview of building projections see [http://projectionist.array.bz/tools/](http://projectionist.array.bz/tools/).
